# Visualisation with Streamlit
With programming a lot of work will happen in the background and will never be seen.
Since all the tweet data will be saved in table form in dataframes and a Postgres Database and the sentiment analysis can be visualised in plots and diagrams, I will try to make a lot of work visible and understandable.

([FR 60])

I will use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for this. Streamlit is an open-source Framework for building simple and interactive Machine-Learning and Data Science Web-Apps.
