# Requirements Analysis

To access the requirements, one normally would use a stakeholder analysis.

Since this project is more like a research project, it is not really intended to be used as a product outside of Chainsulting. Thus, the primary and only stakeholder is one of the CEO's of Chainsulting, Yannik Heinze, who is keen on finding out about the effects of sentiment on trading performance.

In consultation with Mr. Heinze, the requirements for this project have been set beforehand.

The requirements are structured as functional and non-functional with three categories:
- *Must-Have*-Requirements are essential for the system to work at all.
- *Should-Have*-Requirements are improving the system, but are not necessary for the system to run.
- *Optional* Requirements can improve the final product, but not at all necessary.

## Programming Logic
From the above requirements analysis, a flow diagram was derived to simplify and visualise the order of steps that are needed to be taken in the development phase. This helped to split the available time into phases for each part in this diagram. It was basically the key to time-management of this project.
The orange bigger box are the parent steps, in which the smaller steps take place.
