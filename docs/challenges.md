## Heroku
### Database full

### Switching from two to only one coin
The Heroku Database got filled such quickly because I was collecting Tweets about Bitcoin and Cardano.
It would be very interesting to compare different coins side by side, but I decided to only look at Bitcoin after this point, so I can gather more Tweets.
