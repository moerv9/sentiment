    "TextBlob returns polarity and subjectivity of a sentence. Polarity lies between [-1,1], -1 defines a negative sentiment and 1 defines a positive sentiment. Negation words reverse the polarity. TextBlob has semantic labels that help with fine-grained analysis. For example — emoticons, exclamation mark, emojis, etc. Subjectivity lies between [0,1]. Subjectivity quantifies the amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text. The higher subjectivity means that the text contains personal opinion rather than factual information. TextBlob has one more parameter — intensity. TextBlob calculates subjectivity by looking at the ‘intensity’. Intensity determines if a word modifies the next word. For English, adverbs are used as modifiers (‘very good’).

    "\n",
    "Instead of dealing with HTTP Requests, Data Serialisation and Rate Limits it is easier to use pre-built libraries to access the Twitter API and be able to focus more on building functionality. There are hundreds of different libraries but I've found two to be standing out and compared them: Tweepy vs. Twint.\n",

    "**Twint**\n",
    "* Does not need access to the official Twitter API and no Authentication\n",
    "* No limits on tweets\n",
    "* 12,7k Stars on Github with 845 commits (last Commit in March 2021)\n",
    "* Meant for grabbing tweets not for posting or sending DMs\n",
    "* Minimal documentation and not many tutorials\n",

    "* A lot of tutorials and good documentation \n",
    "\n",
    "Twint seems to have the upper hand because it does not need an authentication and has good filters for tweets (even cashtag filter). I wrote a simple test to acquire some tweets with Twint but a few days later this didn't work any longer. It appears that Twint can't retrieve any data. Look at [this](../jupyter_notebooks/SavedCodeSnippets.ipynb#Test-Twint). \n",
    "I cannot say now if this will work later on but since the Github hasn't been updated in more than a year I will just use Tweepy.\n",

    "Getting authorized from Twitter was easy. Login to the [Twitter Developer Portal](developer.twitter.com) and create a new Project and App. There you can generate and copy the neccessary token: API Key and Secret, Bearer Token for Twittert API V2 and the Access Token and Secret. The other four are needed for the Twitter API V1.  \n",
