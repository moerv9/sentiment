# Visualisation with Streamlit


When scripts are running in the background and acting on their own, a lot of work will never be seen.
Since all the tweet and trade data are stored in a database and the sentiment analysis and price charts can be visualised in plots and diagrams, it was specified in the requirements ([FR 60]).

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is an open-source Framework for building simple and interactive Machine-Learning and Data Science Web-Apps. It was perfect for this project, because it contained all the features for charts and dataframes and was easy to implement and therefore allowed rapid prototyping. 

Actually, Streamlit and Jupyter Notebooks were used to test the code before it entered Heroku, because each execution on Heroku consumed dynos and obviously increased the row count in the database.
