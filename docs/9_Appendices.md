## Glossary

</br>

### A
- API
An Application Programming Interface allows two distinct software programs to communicate with each other and use their services. A software's user doesn't get in touch with an API since it works in the background and is only used by the programmer for it's unique features.

- Arbitrage
The process of buying a stock, cryptocurrency or commodity in one place and selling in another at the same time to achieve a profit from different prices.

### B
- Blockchain
A blockchain is a digital file, that every member of a society has stored. All members are equal and have the same (full) file. In regular, defined time periods, new updates are attached to this file inside a block. This is how all the blocks form a chain, thus the name Blockchain.
### C
- Cashtag
Similar to a Hashtag, a Cashtag is an identifier for stocks and cryptocurrencies, starting with a Dollar-Sign ($).
Examples: $TSLA for Tesla stock or $btc for Bitcoin.

### D
- Data Serialisation
The conversion of a data object with it's state into another byte-sized format to either store or transmit it. It can later be translated back by deserialisation. Serialisation is good for creating semantically identical copies of the original data.

### F
- Fiat
A currency that is issued by the government and not backed by any commodity, such as Gold. Central Banks control how much money is printed.
Examples: Euro, US-Dollar, Yen

### G
- Google Authenticator
An App by Google that generates a 6 digit code every minute which can be used when sigining in with 2-Way-Authentification.

### H
- HTTP Request
The message from a client to get information from a server. 

### J
- Jupyter Notebooks
A web-based tool for interactive and fast coding. It is structured as executable cells, which can contain either code, text (markdown), mathematics or plots.

### M
- Market Capitalisation / MCap
The market cap is the definition for the value of a company (or a cryptocurrency in the context of this project). It also shows the dominance and popularity of a cryptocurrency.
To calculate the market cap, the actual price of the coin is multiplied by the total volume. 

### N
- Natural Language Processing / NLP
Computational processing of natural language using rules and methods from linguistics and combines them with modern computer science and artificial intelligence.
Examples: Autocomplete, Spell-Check in Word Processors

### P
- Papertrading
A simulation of the real stock or crypto market, which allows trading with real prices but virtual money.

- Pump & Dump
The fraudulent practice of spreading (false) information about a stock or cryptocurrency to "pump" up the price artificially to be able to sell all the holdings at a high price and therefore dump the price again.
### R
- Regular Expressions / Regex

*Regular Expressions* are searchable patterns inside a string, consisting out of multiple single characters.

### S
- Sandbox
A testing environment to securely try out code without affecting the running software. 

- Sentiment
The overall opinion, mood, feeling about a particular topic. Mostly used in business context for expressing the "feeling" about a stock or cryptocurrency.

- Software-as-a-Service / Saas
Accessing software through the internet without dealing with software or hardware problems. Providers, such as Google or Amazon offer on-demand-service, support, scalability and security.

- Stablecoin
A stablecoin is a "stable" cryptocurrency, because it is pegged to a FIAT-Currency (see FIAT) like the US-Dollar or Gold and therefore not volatile.

- Stakeholder Analysis
An overview over people and organisations and their different amount of influence on the project. It is crucial at the start of a project to define which goals are the most important.
