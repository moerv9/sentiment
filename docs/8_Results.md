## Outlook

Because of the short time of this project, further strategies or improvements of the sentiment strategy were not implemented.
A few other strategies were:
- Looking for single words for "bullish" or "bearish" sentiment
- Using technical indicators like the 20-SMA (20 day single moving average) in combination with sentiment analysis
- Ratio of positive / negative sentiment crossing a particular treshhold
- calculating the weighted average instead of a normal average
