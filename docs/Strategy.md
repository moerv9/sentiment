general sentiment of a coin and if the current trend matches that sentiment 
(if the general sentiment of a coin is positive, then Whitebird expects the coin price should have gone up).

If the current trend doesn't match the coin sentiment, then Whitebird accordingly opens a long/short position (for eg: if the general sentiment of a coin is negative but there is an upward trend in the coin's price, then Whitebird opens a short position).

Whitebird closes a position if a certain threshold has been met or if the coin sentiment changes over time. (sentiment goes from positive to negative)

Simple moving average (sma) is the mean of the data points. For example, if you look at the prices for the last 20 days, the prices of each day will be added together and then divided by 20. 
Each datapoint is weighted equally.

The Exponential moving average (ema) on the other hand gives more value to recent data points.
